    We can initialize two pointers L=0 and R=n-1. Now our window size is n and contains excess elements. We will keep reducing the [L, R] window size till it becomes exactly equal to k. We can do this based on the condition - x - arr[L] <= arr[R] - x. If it is true, then it means arr[R] is farther away from x than arr[L] and thus we will eliminate arr[R]. Otherwise, we will eliminate arr[L].
